# Kuka Industry ðŸš€

Simulate a working environment using the KUKA robot with 7 degrees of freedom (7DoF) on top of the kuka mobile platform. This project features scripts for controlling the robot, implementing vision-based tasks, and managing industrial operations.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Simulate a KUKA robot performing tasks in an industrial environment.
- **Key Features:**
  - Vision-based control.
  - Stock management automation.
  - Robotic arm kinematics.

## How to Get Started
1. **Prerequisites:** MATLAB with Robotics System Toolbox.
2. **Run the Simulation:** Load the `.ttt` file in your simulator and run `main_program.m` in MATLAB.

## Project Structure
- **Scripts:**
  - `main_program.m` - Core simulation script.
  - `arm_Kinematics.m` - Robotic arm calculations.
  - `vision.m` - Vision control implementation.
  - `pick_n_place.m` - Pick and place operation.

- **Folders:**
  - **`Vision_ML/`** - Machine learning scripts for vision.
  - **`images/`** - Image resources.
  - **`docs/`** - Documentation files.

## Future Improvements
Although the programs may not be at the desired level of functionality, they provide a foundation for future enhancements and served as a valuable learning experience.
